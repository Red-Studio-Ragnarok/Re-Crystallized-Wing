Harness the power of the magical winds and the End to travel easily!

![BannerDescription](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/ReCrystallized_Wing/BH_RCW_banner1.webp)

Re-Crystallized Wing is a 1.12.2, 1.19.2 and latest version port of Crystal Wing by bspkrs from 1.8.9, which itself was a port of Crystal Wing by DaftPVF from 1.2.5.

With helpful items you will be able to travel more easily and even save yourself from risky situations.

- The Crystal Wing will get you back to your home (*Using it in the somewhere else than the overworld might yield different results*)
- The Ender Scepter harnesses the power of the ender pearl by allowing you to teleport wherever you look whenever you want.

With in-depth configs, you can customize everything. 
The defaults are for a more modern and balanced experience,
but there are also config options tailored for nostalgia, 
like the nostalgic sounds from Crystal Wing 1.2.5.

If you are in for a nostalgic experience, 
there is also the nostalgic models resource pack that brings back the models from 1.2.5.

Nostalgia is not your thing?
We also have Jappa style textures made by sir_squidly in the resource pack [Modernity](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/modernity).
These are the defaults for Minecraft versions with Jappa style textures, in those versions a Programmer Art resource pack is also available.
